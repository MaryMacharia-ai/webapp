## Project Overview
NilaWriters is a professional content writing service platform designed to connect individuals, students, and businesses with expert writers. The website showcases available writing services such as academic writing, blog writing, content writing, ghostwriting, and brand storytelling. It provides a clean, modern user interface focused on conversions, trust, and accessibility.

## Brand Identity
### Color System
Color System
Primary: Teal Green #1F8A84
Used for call-to-action buttons, stats section, and highlights to communicate trust, growth, and professionalism.
Secondary: Dark Navy #0F172A
Used in the footer and navigation text for strong contrast and authority.
Accent: Soft Beige #F3E5D0
Applied to service cards and backgrounds to create warmth and readability.
Neutral: White #FFFFFF
Used across the main layout for clean spacing and clarity.

### Typography
Headings: Poppins / Sans-Serif
Chosen for its bold, modern, and professional appearance that enhances readability and brand authority.
Body: Inter / Sans-Serif
Optimized for web readability, clean spacing, and accessibility.

## Design Decisions
### Layout Adherence
Spacing was implemented using Tailwind padding utilities (py-12, py-16) for consistent vertical rhythm.
The design follows a section-based layout similar to the Figma reference: https://www.figma.com/design/6m2quKuO5myPkTegr33xoU/Landing-Page?node-id=1-78&t=reggmyT9Fpvi2XyY-1
Tools used:
Browser DevTools
Tailwind responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg)
Mobile-first testing via Chrome responsive mode

### Creative Departures
- Content strategy explanation
Custom service card designs for better content scanning.
- Brand positioning rationale
Trust-building elements such as:
Statistics section (300+ writers, 10k+ orders, 98% satisfaction)
Testimonials section
- MD breakpoint design decisions
On medium (MD) screens:
Grid layout shifts from stacked to two-column layouts for improved readability.

## Component Architecture
The project uses a modular reusable component structure:
Navbar.jsx – Main navigation
Footer.jsx – Website footer
Hero.jsx – Landing hero section
Stats.jsx – Business performance metrics
Services.jsx – Writing services showcase
Testimonials.jsx – Client feedback
Login.jsx & Signup.jsx – User authentication pages
Dashboard.jsx – User dashboard page
Each section is self-contained for maintainability and reuse.

## Performance Optimizations
Code splitting using React component structure
Production build optimization via npm run build
Image lazy loading for large service images
Tailwind CSS purge for removing unused styles
Static hosting for faster load times

## Technologies Used
React: v18+
Tailwind CSS: v3+
React Router DOM: v6+
Vite: Build Tool: vite@7.2.5"
Render: Deployment Platform
"bcryptjs": "^3.0.3",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^17.2.3",
    "express": "^5.1.0",

## Challenges & Solutions
1. Routing Errors on Page Refresh
Problem: /login and /signup returned 404 on refresh.
Solution: Implemented static.json redirect rules to route all traffic to index.html.
2. Deployment Build Failures
Problem: Missing config files and incorrect directory structure.
Solution: Corrected root directory, rebuilt project using Vite, and fixed missing tsconfig references.
3. Component Alignment Issues
Problem: Hero image and text alignment did not match Figma design.
Solution: Used Tailwind grid and flex utilities with controlled spacing and breakpoints.
